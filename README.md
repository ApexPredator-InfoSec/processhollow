C# process hollowing

This is the process hollowing code I used during OSEP. It was clean in all the challenge labs in 2021. Posted on github now because it won't bypass any up to date AV without further tweaking. variables have been renamed for obfuscatation and msfvenom shellcode has been XOR encrypted.
